    description: `I first started at UCLA as a mechanical engineering major, not really because I had an interest or passion for it, but mostly to make my parents proud. While I had taken some computer science classes in high school, my brother was already majoring in it, so I wanted to seem "original" and do something new.

But it didn't take long before I realized my mistake. In just the first quarter, I had classes that were already a slog to get through (Chem 20A, if you know, you know) and while some of the mechanical engineering related clubs were cool, they were tough to get into as a first year. By my second quarter, my mistake became even more apparent as I saw my CS friends tackling the infamous CS32 project "Zombie Dash", a real time survival game.

By Spring, I caved and took the intro CS31 class, and I immediately knew I had to switch. Writing code was so satisfying and the concepts just made sense. I officially made the switch the following Spring, and the rest is history.`,

    description: `At the UCLA Smart Grid Energy Research Center, I took my first step into machine learning. My work was primarily focused on developing the ANT, an autonomous last mile delivery robot.

Some of the things we worked on included using LIDAR sensors to build maps of the local campus, then re-use those to train a model to navigate around the area. I also took over the development of an iOS app that connected to the Linux machine powering the robot, allowing for remote control of the physical robot using [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).`,

I collaborated with UI designers to create a cohesive user experience and provided and received feedback via code review to ensure we kept a solid understanding of all parts of the code and maintained consistent practices.
    
This was also my first introduction to React, and I've only fallen more in love with it since then!`,

I also have the fortune of being able to grow and lead developers, serving as an interface between them and the client, ensuring we follow best practices via code review, and setting realistic project timelines. And lastly, I help guide client product decisions toward more cohesive and user-friendly designs.
