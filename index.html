                    <p>Hi I'm Elwyn! I'm a second generation Filipino-American, pun enthusiast, avid gamer, boba lover, and an aspiring software engineer with interests in machine learning and game development. </p>
                    <p>I discovered a passion for computer science during my time in college. Coming in as a mechanical engineering major, I had no real exposure to computer science until I took an introductory course at UCLA. From there, I fell in love with the problem solving process behind computer science and that wonderous feeling that comes with finishing a new project. My goal is to be able to share that feeling with others, to create things that'll leave them with feelings of amazement, excitement, and happiness.</p>
                    <p>Here on my website I'll be posting updates to any of my projects, hobbies, and life in general. Take a look at some of the other tabs if you have time! </p>

                            During the course of the school year, I've been working with the UCLA organization Blueprint to develop a web application using React for a non-profit
                            that helps connect farmers to other non-profits or individuals to help address food insecurity in the Los Angeles area. My contributions have been in creating
                            the Inventory Manager section of the app! In it, sellers can create, edit, and delete their listings, as well as privatize or publicize them with the click of a button!
                            Additionally, they can also sort or filter listings based on certain attributes of their listings, like the expiration date, price, produce type, etc.

                            Sammie is a game my partner ideated for a game design class that was intended to simulate living with anxiety and other mental health struggles.
                            I was able to help design some game mechanics, and whipped up a demo in pygame that she was actually able to present to her class for her final!

                        <h5> March 2020 </h5>
                        <p>
                            I made a Discord bot in Python in order to have an online Magic: The Gathering draft with some friends! A common problem we had was that other online services
                            would crash if a player disconnected, ruining the draft, or it would make exporting decklists really difficult. To remedy this, I created our own DraftBot! It runs
                            the draft on Discord so any player disconnecting just needs to reconnect to Discord to resume the draft! If they are disconnected for too long, it times out 
                            and automatically picks a card for them. At the end of the draft, it generates a simple .txt file that can be used to import the decklist into Cockatrice, a platform for
                            playing Magic: The Gathering online.

                        <p>I worked on the ANT as a research assistant for SMERC at UCLA. 
                            The ANT is an autonomous last mile delivery robot for larger packages.
                            This project is defintely one of the most interesting and educational projects I've worked on.
                            It's taught me to use softwares and languages like ROS and Swift, and since it is powered by a Linux computer, I've gotten more comfortable using terminal and the command line on Linux.

                    EverWeapon is a top-down RPG I made with the student organization ACM Game Studio at UCLA. The game emphasizes unique boss fights and scaling difficulty. My personal contributions have been in the design of mechanics and environment for each boss and the implementation of the ranger boss's attacks. The GIFs shown here are some of our animations that we have for the player's attacks.

                        In it, I developed and trained a machine learning model using SIFT, SURF, and ORB feature detection in order to classify pictures of rooms with around 70% accuracy. The accuracy for each of these methods of feature detection were compared to discover the most effective one.

                    <h5>February 2019</h5> 
                    ZombieDash is a real time game I implemented for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. In the game, the player rescues citizens from zombies by leading them towards an exit. 
                    The entire project was done using C++. 
                    Some interesting aspects were the design of weapons and other tools for the player to fight off and survive the hordes of zombies.
                    Overall, this project was a really fun way to learn to use data structures to make a real game.

                <p>At least, that's what I'd always thought. 
                But when I came to UCLA for an overnight orientation, Bruin Life Weekend, one of the first things I saw was a competitive dance team: Samahang Modern. 
                They were a subset of Samahang Pilipino, a cultural organization for Filipinos like me.
                And they were really amazing. I'd always wanted to be able to dance, but I'd never been very musically inclined, so I always figured that I just couldn't. </p>
                <p>But then I found a beginner-friendly dance organization - Foundations. 
                    I joined one of their training teams and honestly it was both horrifying and amazing. 
                    It was scary and awkward at first, diving into a group of 30 or so people and dancing in front of them when I'd never even felt comfortable dancing by myself. 
                    But I got to meet so many people, and have so many unforgettable experiences, that I would do all that awkwardness over again.
                    So dance truly has given me so much more than just some movements to music. It's given me a community of supportive friends. It's given me a new creative outlet, a way to express myself in ways words can't. It's given me strength to face and overcome my fears. Dance has really changed me for the better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I joined a competitive dance team, VSU Modern, performed my own choreos in showcases, and competed in multiple competitions!
                    Although my competing days are over for now, I still attend some dance classes and freestyle with my partner when I have time.
